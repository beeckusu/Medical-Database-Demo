# Sample Project: Canadian Medical Database
This project was submitted to the class COMPSCI 3319 - Databases at Western University
in London, Ontario. The purpose of the project was to develop an understanding of PHP
and MySQL and how to integrate database accesses into HTML.

The project was hosted and run on virtual machines provided by Western University that
has since been taken down.
